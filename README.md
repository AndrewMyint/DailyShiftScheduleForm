## Note

This project is a registeration form for scheduling the shifts. <br>
There are 3 main external packages I used in this project which are <br>

[Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/) : A library for building Form without sweat and too much magic inside<br>
[Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup): A library for handling Form validation, a great match with Formik. <br>
[react-autosuggest](https://react-autosuggest.js.org/): It let you to implement a search bar with suggestion mode with custom logic. <br>

For the graphic design, I use [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for all the CSS classes, applied in each component.<br>
